                                    The value of transparency in Spotcomm extends beyond the quality of
                                    the code. Transparency is about trust, integrity, and overall
                                    relations in and outside of work. We strive to create an open,
                                    transparent connection with management, colleagues, and customers.
                                    Honesty, clear communication, and cooperation go hand in hand with
                                    one another and with the client. And if you don't like something:
                                    say it, offer it, or change it!
