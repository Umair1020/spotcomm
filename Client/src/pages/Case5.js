                    <h3>Problems Faced at Dreamworld: </h3> <br />
                    <p className='fs-4'>If you are going to stay at a resort over the weekend, you are simply going to have some access to the internet just to stay connected to the outside world. The management in the meeting had delivered us with a challenge to provide Internet in the Chalet area and other important zones where there was a need for internet. Members frequently complained at the unavailability of WiFi at their disposal.
                        <br /><br />
                        Our Technical head and feasibility team were stunned with the area that was going to be covered but certainly not shaken. During feasibility, nearly 45 rooms in the chalet area needed WiFi access as the existing network had speed, connectivity and range issues.
                        <br /><br />
                        Also there was no centralized WiFi management system at Dreamworld resort and the IT department had to manually fix or check the usage which itself was a hurdle. There was no centralized router for Policy making at these zones and no WiFi controller was available to sync all the access points that were deployed at the site. These access points were old and not upgraded thus not able to connect maximum users or contain the load during the rush hours at Dreamworld.

                    </p><br /><br />
                    <h3 style={{ color: "#7F3E98" }}>Solutions Provided and Technology Used
                    </h3> <br />
                    <p className='fs-4 container'>To tackle the issue of routing and QoS management, we deployed a Mikrotik Routerboard. Through this mikrotik, we created DHCP servers and managed all routing and switching issues through it.
                        <br /><br />
                        To provide WiFi to these 45 rooms in the Chalet area and community center area, we deployed 54 WiFi access points. These were enterprise grade Access Points that had unique specified channels in order to avoid any frequency clash. This smoothen the WiFi throw output throughout the resort and the covered zones.
                        <br /><br />
                        To manage these Access points, we deployed an in-house Server and installed a local controller for monitoring and controlling the access points. Through this, the IT department can locally manage all these access points and monitor there usage, heat map, RAM usage and the can check outages as well if any.
                        <br /><br />
                        A policy was also driven to manage all the usage of Members based on the zones they are in. Chalets was given a different usage pool so they do not face any speed or connectivity issues. Same was done for the VIPs as they are the prime members of the resort.
                        <br /><br />
                        Through our wireless network, the complaint ratio is now minimal. Members enjoy our guest WiFi at the chalet area with smooth connectivity and good speed. People have also praised the smooth WiFi network at the resort on different rating apps as well.
