                    <h3>Problems at start: </h3> <br />
                    <p className='fs-4'>ARY Media group had faced a major issue with their streaming on youtube as their routes were not cleared. They required such optimized bandwidth through which they can stream live on Youtube and on their website.
                        <br />  <br />
                        They also needed an inequal ratio of dedicated connectivity as their primary demand was of a higher ratio of Upload speed rather than the downloading speed. Because ARY has to upload their shows, news coverage and other social media related tasks a lot online, they wanted an optimized route for bandwidth through they can upload flawlessly.

                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Apart from this, they also needed bandwidth with multiple redundancies and failover scenarios. Also they were in dire need of such a connectivity provider who can provide best support services as they had been let down by previous providers in this department as well.
                    </p><br /><br />
                    <h3>Solutions Provided
                    </h3> <br />
                    <p className='fs-4'>We provided an optimized bandwidth with redundant backup from 3 different PoPs. Considering ARY is a giant media group, out network and feasibility team could not compromise on the quality of service. Any downtime in connectivity wouldâ€™ve led to harsh consequences for either as an SLA was signed for maximum uptime.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        We deployed a Mikrotik Routerboard for internal policy making and there routes were fine tuned to optimal level so that the traffic can be routed at the best possible destined routes. Streaming issues were solved through this and now ARY streaming does not face any lag online.

                        <br />
                        <br />
                        We also provided Managed Network Services which included internal wiring in their office space as well as the access points deployment. Access points were deployed strategically so they may cover the entire office premises. Our team continuously monitors the link and our alert generation system helps us alert the customer in event of any changes or shifting from primary to secondary fiber due to any fiber cut.
