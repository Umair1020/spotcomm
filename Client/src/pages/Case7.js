                    Free Fire is a battle royale game developed by Garena which is played by almost 500million people worldwide. The Battle Royale mode accommodates up to 52 players landing on an island without any weapons at start. They must fight to be the last one standing by scavenging weapons and equipment from buildings and by looting fellow players by eliminating them.  This can be a squad play or a solo play depending on the mode you choose.
                    <br /> <br />
                    A world series is accommodated with regional event in every continent while in Pakistan, Free Fire is extremely popular. To promote live events and participation in it, Garena has offered a handsome amount of Cash Rewards for the winning teams while this prize pool increases with every event.
                    <br /> <br />
                    Having a good internet and network plan is very crucial if such E-Sports live events are to be successful as streaming and gaming both requires high speed optimized internet to avoid any glitch on both ends.

                    <h3>Problems Faced by Free Fire Management</h3> <br />
                    <p className='fs-4'>Garena management and agency held e-sports gaming events in different cities of Pakistan and even on different venues within the same city. These events are virtual and live events where they pull good audience for viewership.
                        <br /><br />
                        For Live events, players need good internet connectivity so that they can play Free Fire campaign at a good ping ratio. In e-sports gaming, pings are the most important aspect if you are to be successful. In a dense environment, wireless signals can clash and internet connectivity can fluctuate with all the SMD screens, Sound systems deployed and multiple signal clashes from wireless pocket devices carried around by visitors and players. Free Fire management had faced this issue in multiple events before they approached us.
                        <br /><br />
                        Apart from this, the management required Internet Connectivity over redundancy which any of their previous vendors were unable to provide. Also the network quality was not up to the required standard as there were drop frames during live streaming which had caused an uproar among online viewers, thus getting negative remarks on various social media platforms especially Youtube.
                        <br /><br />
                        Due to dense environment during a live event, players who use the WiFi provided by the Free Fire Company had faced WiFi speed fluctuation issue due to an inaccurate design of wireless network fabrication. The right spot of Access Point deployment was another issue which previous vendors were unable to figure out as due to frequency clashes, the channels were either occupied or clashed with a nearby frequency from another device.

                        <li style={{listStyle: "inside"}}> To further smoothen the entire monitoring of this network setup, we deployed an on-spot network monitoring and support team, whose sole responsibility was to keep check and balance of the network and closely monitor the pings & latencies of the gamer’s game during the live event.</li> <br /> <br />
                        <li style={{listStyle: "inside"}}>  Through wireless engineering, our network team had optimized our WiFi channels after which the connected Gamers did not face any ping or latency issues. They got optimal speed and Pings that matched the international standard required during live gaming.

                            Our Network team had designed a network plan keeping in mind the dense environment of the location, for which our first priority was to channelize the frequencies so they may not clash with other frequencies that were being omitted from external devices.

                        <li style={{listStyle: "inside"}}>
                            To improve the network quality, we used Traffic engineering technique as we optimized all the routes through which the streaming was being streamed live. Those optimize routes were extremely dedicated for the exact servers or destination where the game was being directed to, hence no distraction in the routing department.

                            All servers were onboarded and were made accessible on the network so that there applications can remain operational. At no point during this switching of appliances or onboarding of server, any of the servers went offline. Our Engineers made sure they had all the servers online and operational during revamp.

                            Our Redundant fiber network was so smooth that the transition switch from one fiber to another in case of a fiber cut is within a second thus resolving the issue of Network downtime or any drop frame during streaming of a live event which the management were worried about earlier.

                            Due to our wide spread city wise infrastructure, we were successfully able to provide Bandwidth for Free Fire events with redundant backups something which our competitors were unable to provide. We were successfully able to provide bandwidth for a Free Fire event at multiple locations be it a Stadium, A Studio or an Auditorium.
